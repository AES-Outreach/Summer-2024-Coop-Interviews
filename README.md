# OutStem Coding Challenge

Welcome to the OutStem Coding challenge. Submission instructions are listed below. The deadline to submit this challenge is **Monday January 22nd, 9:00 AM**. We would like to emphasize that we are looking for effort, and that the challenge is just part of our discussion with you during the interview, so donâ€™t worry if your solution is *hacky* or even if it doesnâ€™t work, we want to see it!

## The Challenge

The challenge for this interview is to build a dashboard for the new pizza place "A Slice of Pi". They have just finished their first year of business (2023), and want to see how their pizza sales have performed.

For this challenge you have been provided 3 data sets, [order_data.json](data-sets/order_data.json), [review_data.json](data-sets/review_data.json), and [pricing_data.json](data-sets/pricing_data.json). You will use the data in these files to generate various graphs as described in the Goals section

The design and layout of the website is totally up to you (feel free to use any UI libraries), though you will be judged on the look, feel, and usability of your application, so do your best to respect best practices in web design.

In addition, you're welcome to use any existing libraries to generate your graphs or implement other form elements.

## Data Sets
The first data set [order_data.json](data-sets/order_data.json) is a list of orders that were placed, has the following format:

```
[
    {
        "order_id": integer,
        "store": string, one of (Kanata, Orleans,  Downtown, Sandy Hill, and The Glebe),
        "items": [
            {
                "type": string, one of (Cheese, Pepperoni, Deluxe, Hawaiian, Meatlovers),
                "size": string, one of (S, M, L)
            }
        ],
        "date": string in the format YYYY-MM-DD
    },
    ...
]
```

The second data set [review_data.json](data-sets/review_data.json) is a list of customer reviews, and has the following format:

```
[
    {
        "review_id": integer,
        "sentiment": string, one of (delighted, happy, sad, angry),
        "store": string, one of (Kanata, Orleans,  Downtown, Sandy Hill, and The Glebe),
        "date": string in the format YYYY-MM-DD,
        "message": string
    },
    ...
]
```

The third data set [pricing_data.json](data-sets/pricing_data.json) describes the price for each pizza, first based on the type, and then based on the size

**Sample:**
```
{
  "Cheese": {
    "S": 8,
    "M": 12,
    "L": 16
  },
  ...
}
```


## Goals
This challenge has multiple goals that increase in level of difficulty, implement as many of these goals as you are able to.



### Goal 1
Show a simple pie chart based on the review_data.json, showing how many reviews of each sentiment (happy, sad, etc) A Slice of Pi received in 2023


### Goal 2
Add a simple bar chart showing how many orders were placed in each store (Kanata, Orleans... etc)


### Goal 3
Add a display of the total money made in 2023 by computing the price of each pizza sold and adding them all.


### Goal 4
Create a line chart showing how much money was made by month in 2023

### Goal 5
To your chart from Goal 2, add the ability to filter the data by
- pizza type
- pizza size


### Goal 6
Add a start and end date filter at the top of the page, and filter the charts from goals 1, 2, and 5 by these start and end dates



## Bonus Challenges
If you're done and looking for more challenges, here are some extra ideas!:

- Explore further chart types to show the data in a more complex manner
- Show off your design skills with a snazzy layout and header
- Add animations to your page elements
